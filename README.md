# Problems

Welcome to the **Problems** repository! This is a learning project focused on algorithm implementation and problem-solving. The application provides a web interface for practicing coding problems with immediate feedback through automated tests.

---

## üìö **Project Overview**

The **Problems** repository currently offers:
- **Two Core Problems:** Anagram checking and the Knapsack problem
- **Web Interface:** A simple, clean interface for viewing problems and their descriptions
- **Code Testing:** Basic test validation for submitted solutions
- **Problem Documentation:** Markdown-based problem descriptions with examples

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Current Implementation**

1. **Problem Structure:**
   - Each problem is self-contained with its implementation and tests
   - Problems are categorized by difficulty (Easy/Medium)
   - Test cases validate core functionality

2. **Web Interface:**
   - FastAPI backend with Jinja2 templates
   - Problems are displayed with Markdown formatting
   - Basic routing between problems and documentation

---

## üõ† **Technology Stack**

- **Backend:**
  - Python 3.10+
  - FastAPI for the web framework
  - Pytest for test cases

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML/CSS for layout and styling
  - Basic JavaScript for interactivity
  - Markdown rendering for problem descriptions

- **Development Tools:**
  - Poetry for dependency management
  - Ruff for linting
  - MyPy for type checking
