## üìö **Project Overview**

The **Problems** repository allows users to solve various coding challenges with the following features:
- **Detailed Problem Descriptions:** Each challenge includes a clear problem statement with examples.
- **Integrated Code Editor:** A browser-based code editor (powered by **CodeMirror**) to write and test your solutions.
- **Automated Test Cases:** Each challenge runs predefined tests to verify the correctness of your code.
- **Instant Feedback:** Get real-time results in the interactive console.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

1. **Choose a Problem:**
   Browse the available challenges and select one based on its difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

2. **Write Your Code:**
   Use the built-in editor

3. **Test Your Solution:**
   - Click the "Test" button to evaluate your solution.
   - The results of the tests (pass/fail) are displayed in the console output.

4. **Iterate and Improve:**
   Debug and improve your solution until it passes all test cases.
