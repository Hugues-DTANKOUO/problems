## Level: *`Easy`*

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging
the letters of a different word or phrase, typically
using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example:

- The words **"listen"** and **"silent"** are anagrams of each other.
- The words **"triangle"** and **"integral"** are anagrams of each other.
- The words **"evil"** and **"vile"** are anagrams of each other.

```python
>is-anagram listen silent
True
>
>is-anagram triangle integral
True
>
>is-anagram evil vile
True
>
>is-anagram hello world
False
```
