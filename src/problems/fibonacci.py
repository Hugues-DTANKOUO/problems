## Level: *`Easy`*

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum
of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.

## Examples:

- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1
- F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2
- F(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 8

```python
>fibonacci(0)
0
>
>fibonacci(6)
8
>
>fibonacci(10)
55
>
>fibonacci(20)
6765
```

## Notes:
- Input must be a non-negative integer
- Time limit: 1 second for n <= 35
