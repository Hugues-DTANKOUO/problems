Welcome to our collection of programming challenges! Here you'll find a variety of problems to help you improve your coding skills. Each problem is carefully designed to test different aspects of programming and algorithmic thinking.

## 🔍 Problem Categories

### <u><a> [1. 🟢 **Anagram Checker** - *Easy*](/src/problems/anagram.py) </a></u>
<br>

Test your string manipulation skills by determining if two words are anagrams of each other.

**Key Concepts:**
- String manipulation
- Character counting
- Hash tables
- Time complexity optimization

**Example:**
```python
> is_anagram("listen", "silent")
True
> is_anagram("hello", "world")
False
```

### <u><a> [2. 🟡 **Knapsack Problem** - *Medium*](/src/problems/knapsack.py) </a></u>
<br>

A classic optimization problem that tests your understanding of dynamic programming.

**Key Concepts:**
- Dynamic programming
- Optimization
- Array manipulation
- Decision making with constraints

**Example:**
```python
> knapsack(weight_capacity=50, weights=[10,20,30], values=[60,100,120])
220
```
